LibNova Sunrise and Sunset Calculator
=====================================

What is it?
-----------
The LibNova Sunrise and Sunset calculator is a simple iOS application which is used
to calculate the user's sunrise or sunset. There are four types of sunrise and sunsets.
They are: standard, civil, nautical, and astronomical. The user will see all 4 types
in this application. The user has the choice to select their city from a list of, or
if they have an internet connection, they are able to get their coordinates directly
from the iOS device.

The Sunrise and Sunset Calculator is dependent upon the LibNova library. The Xcode
Workspace provided assumes the user has correctly linked the header files in
$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/src/. If the user is unable to build these required dependencies
the application will not run. The user is able to copy these files provided in the
"libnova" folder and the project will run. Screenshots are also provided of the applic-
ation running correctly, in case the user is not able to properly run the applciation.
